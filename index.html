		<h1> About Me</h1>

		<img class= "auth-image" src= "Assets/Image/Images/Lettieinyellow.jpg"  Alt="Lettie">
		<p> I am a young professional from South Carolina looking to make a splash in the Charlotte market. I went to college in Washington, DC, and afterwards moved to New York City where I've spent the majority of my twenties. In New York I've worked in account manangement for one of the largest marketing research companies in the world, and though while an amazing experience didn't provide the challenge I was looking for in my career. In an effort to recenter myself I decided to move closer to my roots and ended up in Charlotte. 
		</p>
		Over the last few months I've been questions myself on what I would really love to do and development kept popping in my head, the ability to be artisitic, technical, and savvy all at the same time. Few career paths offer this type of flexibility and I know I have to take advantage of it. This is my opportunity to reinvent myself again and this time as a coder.
